This is the official test case for Hello World.
During the contest, the official test cases will be
hidden from your view. The official test cases are
typically much larger, and cover a much wider range
of possible outcomes, than the sample one provided
in the problem packet. Make sure you carefully read
each problem description to ensure your programs
cover every possible situation allowed by the input
constraints. Again, good luck!
