[Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind   ]

[Born below the ever cloud-capped peaks that gave the mountains  ]
[their name, the wind blew east, out across the Sand Hills, once ]
[the shore of a great ocean, before the Breaking of the World.   ]
[Down it flailed into the Two Rivers, into the tangled forest    ]
[called the Westwood, and beat at two men walking with a cart and]

[A common belief is that "antidisestablishmentarianism" is the   ]
[longest word in the English language, but this is not true. For ]
[one thing, some major dictionaries no longer include that word, ]
[noting its lack of use. For another, other words exist which are]
[in fact longer. The Oxford English Dictionary contains the word ]
["Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism" which contains 30 letters. The ]
[longest word in the OED is actually 45 letters long, however    ]
[there is some dispute as to whether this is legitimately the    ]
[longest English word, as it was deliberately coined to be the   ]
[longest word, and even the OED admits it is "artificial." The   ]
[word, "Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis," was meant]
[to be a synonym for the disease silicosis, although very        ]
[specifically when caused by inhaling very fine particles of     ]
[volcanic ash. There are yet further claims for longest word not ]
[recognized by any major dictionary. The longest "word" ever to  ]
[appear in literature is 182 letters long; the longest ever to be]
[formally published is the name of a chemical, 1,909 letters     ]
[long; and the longest known chemical name is that of the protein]
[commonly known as "titin," at 189,819 letters long. Given that  ]
[attempting to speak the full name of titin out loud would take  ]
[over an hour (assuming there were no mistakes), there is        ]
[considerable dispute to the claim that this is in fact the      ]
[longest word in any language, let alone English.                ]
